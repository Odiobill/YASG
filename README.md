# YASG
## Yet Another Snake Game

While you can find a couple of basic scenes to show how to use the 
[NMKR SDK for Godot plugin](https://github.com/Odiobill/NmkrGodot)
in your projects under the "examples" directory, we built a simple but complete
game to provide a more comprensive scenario that showcases how to implement the
most common Web3-related tasks, like:
	- Create new NFTs
	- Mint NFTs and deliver them to the user's wallet
	- Verify users' wallet
	- Reading the users' wallet to find the required content
	- Use any FT or NFT as game assets
	- Use the metadata attached to any NFT for changing game features

YASG, like the plugin itself, is a fully open-source project released under the
MIT license.
